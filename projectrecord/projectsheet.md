# Concept:	
    
    this project is setup to pratice me in my skill of web-developer.

    with base on real world demand skill.


## target:	

    - create Web-app. To show register information.
	- practice front (react + bootstrap) and backend (postgres, node.js) skill


## Front-End Summary :

    *   particle-config can be seperate from css into sub-module and use import to use it.
    *   componentdidmount is a one of useful method to running code when having render event.
    *   using CSS-styling to modify item such as positon, margin or sizing.
    *   setting route in front-end should be considered.
    *   using swich-case to change route is okay but not friendly to coding.
    *   parent-children properties sharing (state change) is important in React.
    *   using JS loop method to handle with JSON object.
    *   main concept of React is distribuite work into component (reuse and systematic).

### Front-End need to learn more :

        -   Position using in CSS.
        -   JavaScript Loop method.
        -   flex/grid/inline block.
        -   React propertie transfer.
        -   React componentMount.
        -   Selection condition (JS or React syntax).


## Back-End Summary
    *   start project with npm init.
    *   install all essental package (expreess, cors, body-parse).
    *   install extend package what you nedd (knex , pg).
    *   use post-man to test your server without having front-end.
