# Concept:	
    
    this project is setup to pratice me in my skill of web-developer.

    with base on real world demand skill.


## target:	

    - create Web-app. To show register information.
	- practice front (react + bootstrap) and backend (postgres, node.js) skill


## Front-End Summary :

    *   particle-config can be seperate from css into sub-module and use import to use it.
    *   componentdidmount is a one of useful method to running code when having render event.
    *   using CSS-styling to modify item such as positon, margin or sizing.
    *   setting route in front-end should be considered.
    *   using swich-case to change route is okay but not friendly to coding.
    *   parent-children properties sharing (state change) is important in React.
    *   using JS loop method to handle with JSON object.
    *   main concept of React is distribuite work into component (reuse and systematic).

### Front-End need to learn more :

        -   Position using in CSS.
        -   JavaScript Loop method.
        -   flex/grid/inline block.
        -   React propertie transfer.
        -   React componentMount.
        -   Selection condition (JS or React syntax).


## Back-End Summary
    *   start project with npm init.
    *   install all essental package (expreess, cors, body-parse).
    *   install extend package what you nedd (knex , pg, nodemon).
    *   use post-man to test your server without having front-end.
    *   use knex-api for connect and mange with postgres-sql (pg)
    *   careful for table structure and condition when create in psql.
    *   fetch / api method will respone in Promise javascript.
    *   should create api by RESTful-API.

### Back-End need to learn more :

        -   read how to set REST-ful API.
        -   practice using post-man to test your server.
        -   try to learn more SQL-language.
        -   learn more Promise javascript method.
        -   practice using another API (read manuscript and using).


##  Deploy on Heroku summarry
    *   first install heroku command line (CLI) to using CLI in terminal.
    *   create Heroku project and link with githup repo
    *   every change we need to update on githup before push to heroku.
    *   Heroku Database have some specific config, We must set by follow construction.
    *   Deploy servicer side fisrt to check URL/Req,res/API can work normally.
    *   Setting Database have some specific config we must follow documentation.
    *   Script is important to server run code you should understand what code computor will run.

 ### Deploy need to learn more :

        -   pratice to use another Deploy tools.
        -   Cloud must learn in futer.
        -   learn another database like mongoDB.
