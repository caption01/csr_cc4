## FULLSTACK-WEBDEVELOPER
This Project was created for practice both of web-developer task (front&back).
	in front-End we try to use **React** and **Boostap4** because it is real-world skill demand from my research.
	for Back-End we choose **Node.js** to be backbond with **Postgres-SQL** database struture in the project. At last, to online my demo-web app. most popular choice is **heruko** to be free cloud server in prototype scale.

I hope this project will be one of example for everone who try to learn in **FULLSTACK-WEBDEVELOPER** .
